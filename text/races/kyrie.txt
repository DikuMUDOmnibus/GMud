HISTORY: 
The typical kyrie resembles a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing. Kenku have both arms and wings. 
The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a distance for a large backpack. 
Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet. The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face 
markings. The eyes are a brilliant yellow. 

Kenku are a secretive race that lives among the human and demihuman races without the bulk of the 
population ever being aware of their presence. 

The actual structure of kyrie society is elusive. The kyrie themselves either refuse to comment or 
lie. Those kyrie lairs that have been encountered tend to be small underground chambers or cave 
complexes.
