HISTORY: 
Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their 
foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright, but their 
arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange 
to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin. Their eyes vary 
from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull 
soiled-looking colors. 

Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few 
tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only active at night or on very dark, cloudy 
days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat 
resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth. 

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have 
separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept 
with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own 
garments and leather goods. The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins.
