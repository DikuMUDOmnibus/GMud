HISTORY: 
Tigriat have spotted coats ranging in color from light yellow to brownish red. These graceful feline 
humanoids are tall and slender, with retractable claws, and eyes of green or yellow. 

Tigriat are reclusive and avoid other intelligent beings, even other tabaxi clans. They do not engage 
in trade, which they consider demeaning, but some few have agents who trade for them. Tigriat speak 
their own ancient language. Legends tell of a great tabaxi civilization that was supplanted by other 
races. 

Tigriat have few natural enemies. For food, they prefer the boar-like peccaries and huge rodents 
called capybaras; only a very degenerate clan attacks members of another intelligent species for food. 
Tigriat are sometimes hunted for their pelts, worth up to 250 gp each. Their skins and claws are also 
useful in some types of natural magic.
