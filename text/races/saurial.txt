HISTORY: 
Adult Saurial stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weighing 200 to 250 pounds. Skin tones range from dark green 
to gray to brown, and their scales give them a flecked appearance. Their tails average 3 to 4 feet 
long and are not prehensile. Males are nearly impossible to distinguish from females without close 
inspection. Saurial garb is limited to strings of bones and other barbaric ornament. 

Saurial are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places, often (35%) dwelling totally 
underwater in air-filled caves. A tribe rarely numbers more than 150 individuals, including females 
and hatchlings. It is not uncommon for several tribes in an area to forge an informal alliance against 
outsiders, including other saurial tribes.
