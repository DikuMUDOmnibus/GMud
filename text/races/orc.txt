HISTORY: 
Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in tribes and survive by 
hunting and raiding. Orcs believe that in order to survive they must expand their territory, and so 
they are constantly involved in wars against many enemies: humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other 
orc tribes. 

Orcs vary widely in appearance, as they frequently crossbreed with other species. In general, they 
resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped 
posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial 
feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth 
for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a 
slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to 
glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical 
system, a pigment which gives them infravision. Male orcs are about 5? to 6 feet tall. Females average 
6 inches shorter than males. Orcs prefer to wear colors that most humans think unpleasant: blood red, 
rust red, mustard yellow, yellow green, moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor 
is unattractive besides -- dirty and often a bit rusty. Orcs speak Orcish, a language derived from 
older human and elvish languages. There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has many 
dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Orcs have also learned to speak local common tongues, but are 
not comfortable with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hobgoblin, and ogre 
dialects.
