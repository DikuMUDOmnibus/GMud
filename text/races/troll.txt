HISTORY: 
Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to tropical jungles. Most 
creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their 
frame appears thin and frail, but trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long and 
ungainly. The legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with sharpened 
claws. The trolls' rubbery hide is colored a moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A 
writhing hairlike mass grows out of their skulls and is usually greenish black or iron gray in color. 
Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from 
males; they are both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts. 

Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls' gait is uneven and, when 
running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are 
very agile. They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with an 80% chance of success. 
Trolls have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is superior. 

Trolls have no language of their own, using ``trollspeak'', a guttural mishmash of common, giant, 
goblin, orc, and hobgoblin. 

Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense forests and subterranean locales, since bright 
sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suffer no combat penalties because of this. They usually make their 
lairs in caves, using great boulders to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a number of rough 
nests made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from victims. If there are no caves 
in an area, trolls dig themselves a trollhole and cover its opening with twigs and leaves.
