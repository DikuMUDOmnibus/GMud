HISTORY: 
Orcs will crossbreed with virtually every humanoid and demihuman species except elves, with whom they 
cannot. The mongrel offspring of orcs and these other species are known as half-orcs. Orc-goblins, 
orc-hobgoblins, and orc-humans are the most common. Half-orcs tend to favor the orcish strain heavily, 
and as such are basically orcs, although 10% of these offspring can pass as ugly humans. 

Half-orcs are distrusted by both human and orc cultures because they remind each of the other's racial 
stock. Half-orcs advance in orc culture by flaunting their superior ability and in human culture by 
associating with people who don't care about appearance. Most tend toward neutrality with slight 
lawful and evil tendencies, but lawful good half-orcs are not unknown. Some half-orcs have split from 
both cultures to form their own societies in remote areas. These half-orcs worship their own gods and 
(like most hermits) are extremely suspicious of strangers.
