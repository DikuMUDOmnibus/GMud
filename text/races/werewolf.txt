HISTORY: 
Werewolves are the most feared of the lycanthropes, men who can transform into wolflike beasts. They 
should not be confused with wolfweres (q.v.) -- wolves who turn into men. Great enmity exists between 
werewolves and wolfweres. 

The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits. The werewolf form is equally varied. Many 
have a bipedal form that is a hybrid of human and lupine features. These creatures are about 1-foot 
taller and stronger than their human forms. The bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wolflike 
legs, and heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and lupine features. 
A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mistaken for a large wolf when it runs on all 
four legs. This hybrid can also walk erect and has humanlike hands. 

Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a large wolf about the size of a bear. This 
creature has no human features, although the eyes may glow red in the dark. 

Werewolf packs roam the wilderness in search of human or other prey. True werewolves tend to be 
nomadic, although infected werewolves often continue to live the life to which they were accustomed. 
Werewolves retreat to their dens during the winter months or the years when the females are raising 
the helpless cubs. As humans, werewolves do not build homes, although they may take over existing 
dwellings, sometimes the home of past victims. Caves and burrows are the dens most commonly used in 
the wild. These sparsely furnished retreats are used mostly as a sleeping area and a place to store 
their human possessions. Many werewolf families roam the countryside in wagons, much like gypsies. In 
fact, this has caused many gypsies to be accused of being werewolves. 

Werewolves live in packs, generally related by bloodlines. Werewolf packs of five to eight individuals 
are single family groups consisting of a male, female, and three to six cubs, six to nine years old. 
Cubs under six years old are kept in secluded dens and never encountered by hostile humans.
