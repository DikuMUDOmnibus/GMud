0 RHISTORY_ELF~
HISTORY: 
Elves tend to be somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal humans. Their 
features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. 
Although they appear fragile and weak, as a race they are quick and strong. 
Elves often live to be over 1,200 years old, although long before this time 
they feel compelled to depart the realms of men and mortals. Where they go 
is uncertain, but it is an undeniable urge of their race. 

Elves are often considered frivolous and aloof. In fact, they are not, although
humans often find their personalities impossible to fathom. They concern 
themselves with natural beauty, dancing and frolicking, playing and singing, 
unless necessity dictates otherwise. They are not fond of ships or mines, but 
enjoy growing things and gazing at the open sky. Even though elves tend toward 
haughtiness and arrogance at times, they regard their friends and associates as 
equals. They do not make friends easily, but a friend (or enemy) is never 
forgotten. They prefer to distance themselves from humans, have little love for 
dwarves, and hate the evil denizens of the woods. 

Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. Elves are brave but never
foolhardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead and wine, but seldom to excess. 
While they find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to behold, they are not overly 
interested in money or gain. They find magic and swordplay (or any refined combat 
art) fascinating. If they have a weakness it lies in these interests.

Stats can be trained to a maximum of 92 points to all combined stats.
By totaling your natural STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON if they total 92 then
you are at your maximum stats.

35 is the maximum stat attainable through magical items. However 30 is
the maximum natural stat value. All races 100 possible totals for stats
leaving room for diversity in characters. All races start with 10 for
all stats at level 1 and get 11 training points to begin with.

Example of stats maximums is this human can have 20 natural all stats
+2 for class bonus so a human warrior (+2 Str) can have stats of
Str: 22 Int: 20 Wis 20 Dex 20 Con 20
but can only train the stat to a total of 92 points so his stats may
look something like this at full stats.
Str: 21 Int: 17 Wis: 18 Dex: 17 Con: 19
Which is added all together totals 92 (21+17+18+17+19) = 92

But can enhance each of those stats by +5 with spells and eq.

0 RHISTORY_ARCHON~
HISTORY: 
The archon are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of 
the highest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds 
in peace and solitude. 

Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet. About 
halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized 
fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the 
length of the wing and locks in place for flying. Though the wing-hands 
cannot grasp during flight, they are nearly as useful as human hands 
when an archon is on the ground and its wings are folded back. The wing 
muscles anchor in a bony chest plate that provides the archon with extra 
protection. The powerful legs end in four sharp talons that can unlock 
and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands, also with three 
human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. The hand bones, like the rest 
of an archon's skeleton, are hollow and fragile. 

Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They have 
gray-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide 
keen binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally
males are red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray. Aarakocra 
have little to do with other species, including neighboring archon tribes, and 
leave their home territory only in extreme circumstances. They rarely 
encounter humans except for an occasional foray into a rural community to 
snatch a stray farm animal; this is not an intentionally malicious act, as 
archon are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild animals. A human 
venturing into archon territory may be able to convince one to serve as a 
guide or a scout in exchange for a shiny jewel or coin.

0 RHISTORY_BARBARIAN~
HISTORY: 
Barbarians belong to primitive cultures that possess rudimentary skills such 
as animal husbandry and simple manufacturing (weaving, carving). They may 
live in villages of simple buildings or in portable structures like tents, 
tepees, yurts, or wagons. In aquatic regions, they may live on watercraft 
like canoes or rafts. 

Barbarians are typically armed with swords, knives, bows, spears, and clubs.
Armor is limited to shields, helmets, and chestplates. They tend to be 
hostile toward unfamiliar wizards

0 RHISTORY_DUERGAR~
HISTORY: 
The duergar are instantly recognizable by the small twisted horns on their 
heads, and grey skin. Most male duergar are bearded as well. It is not 
unheard of for female duergar to have beards as well, and most who do are 
considered among the most attractive women of their kind. Duergar are 
private peoples preferring to live amongst their own than any other. 
Occasionally, duergar have been known to live in some of the smaller 
settlements, but these are only the most gregarious of their kind. 

Duergar have often been labeled "grey-dwarves" due to their close kinship to 
the dwarves and as a matter of fact are a type dwarf themselves though a
millennia of separation has given them some unique features like their grey
pigment. They live in subterranean areas or areas which remain dark most of 
the time.

Duergar are consummate craftsmen often skilled in stone and metal alchemy. 
They are extreme perfectionists and would rather start a project anew 
than produce a flawed work. It is for this quality that duergar craftsmanship 
is so desired. A duergar who produces faulty workmanship is forever disgraced 
by the rest of his or her people. Deliberately selling a crafted weapon or 
tool with an imperfection is the worst offense imaginable to them tantamount 
to murder. 

In general alchemy is thought to be a natural part of the world within Duergar
society and it is a means of ranking duergar within their society. Duergar are
cunning and like their nearest brothers the dwarves are also renowned warriors
for their ferocity in battle.

HISTORY: 
The Dracons are a magical race created by an evil mage in a effort to dominate
the known world. He used the dracon for a short time until they eventually
rebelled against his rule. They are now free and still often travel in numbers
as well as are still considered war like. They strongest rules the clan and 
has first choice of mates.

The dracon are an organized people with strict rules and edict which must be 
obeyed. Not doing so could cost you your life.

0 RHISTORY_DROW~
HISTORY: 
These dreaded, evil creatures were once part of the community of elves that 
still roam the world's forests. Now these dark elves inhabit black caves and 
winding tunnels under the earth, where they make dire plans against the 
races that still walk beneath the sun, on the surface of the green earth. 
Drow have black skin and pale, usually white hair. They are shorter and more 
slender than humans, seldom reaching more than 5 feet in height. Male drow 
weigh between 80 and 110 pounds, and females between 95 and 120 pounds. Drow 
have finely chiseled features, and their fingers and toes are long and 
delicate.Like all elves, they have higher Dexterity and lower Constitution 
than men. 

Drow clothing is usually black, functional, and often possesses special 
properties, although it does not radiate magic. For example, drow cloaks 
and boots act as if they are cloaks of and boots of elvenkind, except that 
the wearer is only 75% likely to remain undetected in shadows or to surprise
enemies. The material used to make drow cloaks does not cut easily and is 
fire resistant, giving the cloaks a+6 bonus to saving throws vs. fire. These 
cloaks and boots fit and function only for those of elven size and build. Any
attempt to alter a drow cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material, 
making it useless. 

In the centuries they've spent underground, drow have learned the languages 
of many of the intelligent creatures of the underworld. Besides their own 
tongue, an exotic variant of elvish, drow speak both common and the 
subterranean trade language used by many races under the earth. They speak 
the languages of gnomes and other elves fluently. 

Drow also have their own silent language composed of both signed hand 
movements and body language. These signs can convey information, but not 
subtle meaning or emotional content. If within 30 feet of another drow, they 
can also use complex facial expressions, body movements, and postures to 
convey meaning. Coupled with their hand signs, these expressions and gestures 
give the drow's silent language a potential for expression equal to most 
spoken languages. 

Long ago, dark elves were part of the elven race that roamed the world's 
forests. Not long after they were created, though, the elves found themselves
torn into rival factions+one following the tenets of evil, the other owning 
the ideals of good (or at least neutrality). A great civil war between the 
elves followed, and the selfish elves who followed the paths of evil and chaos
were driven into the depths of the earth, into the bleak, lightless caverns 
and deep tunnels of the underworld. These dark elves became the drow. 

The drow no longer wish to live upon the surface of the earth. In fact, few 
who live on the surface ever see a drow. But the dark elves resent the elves 
and faeries who drove them away, and scheme against those that dwell in the 
sunlight. 

Drow live in magnificently dark, gloomy cities in the underworld that few 
humans or demihumans ever see. They construct their buildings entirely out 
of stone and minerals, carved into weird, fantastic shapes. Those few surface 
creatures that have seen a dark elf city (and returned to tell the tale) 
report that it is the stuff of which nightmares are made. 

Drow society is fragmented into many opposing noble houses and merchant 
families, all scrambling for power. In fact, all drow carry brooches 
inscribed with the symbol of the merchant or noble group they are allied 
with, though they hide these and do not show them often. The drow believe 
that the strongest should rule; their rigid class system, with a long and 
complicated list of titles and prerogatives, is based on the idea. 

They worship a dark goddess, called Lolth by some, and her priestesses hold 
very high places in society. Since most drow priests are female, women tend 
to fill nearly all positions of great importance. 

Drow fighters go through rigorous training while they are young. Those who 
fail the required tests are killed at the program's conclusion. That is why 
dark elf fighters of less than 2nd level are rarely seen outside a drow city. 

Drow often use giant Dragonkins as pack animals, and frequently take bugbears 
or troglodytes as servants. Drow cities are havens for evil beings, including 
mind flayers, and drow are allied with many of the underworld's evil 
inhabitants. On the other hand, they are constantly at war with many of their 
neighbors beneath the earth, including dwarves or dark gnomes (svirfneblin) 
who settle to close to a drow city. Dark elves frequently keep slaves of all 
types, including past allies who have failed to live up to drow expectations.

0 RHISTORY_DWARF~
HISTORY: 
Dwarves are short, stocky fellows, easily identified by their size and shape. 
They average 4 to 4-? feet tall. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark 
hair. Dwarves generally live for 350 years. 

Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work and care 
little for most humor. They are strong and brave. They enjoy beer, ale, mead,
and even stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is precious metal, 
particularly gold. They prize gems, of course, especially diamonds and opaque 
gems (except pearls, which they do not like). 

Dwarves like the earth and dislike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they 
have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. Their short, stocky builds make them
ill-suited for riding horses or other large mounts (although ponies present no
difficulty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious and wary of these creatures.
They are ill-disposed toward magic and have little talent for it, but revel in 
fighting, warcraft, and scientific arts such as engineering. 

Though dwarves are suspicious and avaricious, their courage and tenacity more
than compensate for these shortcomings. 

Dwarves typically dwell in hilly or mountainous regions. They prefer life in 
the comforting gloom and solidness that is found underground. They have 
several special abilities that relate to their underground life, and they 
are noted for being particularly resistant to magics and poisons.
