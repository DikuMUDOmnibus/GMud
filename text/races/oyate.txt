HISTORY: 
These are the native People of Ghost Dancer. They are reclusive people 
preferring to hunt and fish in small family groups known as tribes. The 
Oyate stand about 5'9" to 6' and resemble elves in many features. They 
are skilled hunters and trackers (scouts) and can be fearsome warriors. 
They have a reddish appearance to their skin, which protects them from 
the bright Ghost Dancer sun. They can be found in even the harshest of 
climates. 

Little else is known about the Oyate except that when provoked the 
outcome is almost always fatal. 

The Oyate were here before any other race and Ghost Dancer was 
beautiful. They were the first new race introduced to Ghost Dancer the 
most beautiful of all the worlds the gods had created. This is why they 
choose Ghost Dancer to become mortals on. With the introduction of the 
gods came the introduction or the other races (elves, humans, dwarves), 
the Oyate fled to solitude leaving a great mystery as to who they are 
and what they believe. However two of the immortals befriended the Oyate 
and learned their culture. Impressed by their simple life one of these 
immortals took an Oyate name Cormac (Cor ha mac "Eternal Life" God of 
the after Life) he is their god and his mate also Oyate Taka is 
their goddess. They have adopted Taka to mean (Tha-cka "sweet 
life" God of Life) and pray regularly to them. The only other god in 
their religious system is Makoce (mah-koh-chay "Mother Earth"). They are 
highly spiritual and social having a language known as Lakota. After the 
arrival of the other races the Oyate retreated into the depths of the 
wilderness and few have ever been spotted. To this day the Oyate are 
more a myth than a reality. But as of late the myth has emerged into the 
public view more and more as Oyate have been spotted in increasing numbers 
around larger cities and roads throughout the whole of Ghost Dancer. 
Is this a new trend?
