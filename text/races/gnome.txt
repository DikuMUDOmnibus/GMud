HISTORY: 
Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly 
maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Their noses, however, are significantly larger. Most 
gnomes have dark tan or brown skin and white hair. A typical gnome lives for 350 years. 
Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a great love of 
living things and finely wrought items, particularly gems and jewelry. Gnomes love all sorts of 
precious stones and are masters of gem polishing and cutting. 

Gnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling, rocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited by humans. Their 
diminutive stature has made them suspicious of the larger races--humans and elves--although they are 
not hostile. They are sly and furtive with those they do not know or trust, and somewhat reserved even 
under the best of circumstances. Dwelling in mines and burrows, they are sympathetic to dwarves, but 
find their cousins' aversion to surface dwellers foolish.
