-1 DIKU~
.                    Original game idea, concept, and design:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)


Developed at: DIKU -- The Department of Computer Science
                      at the University of Copenhagen.

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Ghost Dancer's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Shadow Dancer's jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 AFK Replay~
Syntax: afk <optional message>
Syntax: Replay

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

You can set an away message, letting other people know the reason for your
absence. It will show up in the "Who" listing.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        {W%h {M:  {GDisplay your current hits{x
        {W%H {M:  {GDisplay your maximum hits{x

        {W%c {M:  {GDisplay a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts){x
	{B *** Prompts by Taka *** {x
        {W%O {M:  {GDisplay your current hits in Percentage form{x
        {W%P {M:  {GDisplay your current mana in Percentage form{x
        {W%Q {M:  {GDisplay your current moves in Percentage form{x
        {W%S {M:  {GDisplay the current Stock value.{x

	    {W%b {M:  {GDisplay enemy health in graphical form.{x
        {W%B {M:  {GDisplay enemy health in percentage form.{x
	{D *** Immortal Prompts Only *** {x

        {W%z {M:  {GDisplay the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY){x
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"

~

0 DEATH DIE~
When you're in combat, and your opponent is hitting you enough, at some point
your health/hitpoints will run out. You will die then.

When your character dies, you are reincarnated in the morgue. You will find 
your corpse at your feet. It holds all the equipment you had when you died.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~

0 MORGUE~
Your boby upon death is sent to the morgue.
This is an optional function on Ghost and on various muds will vary.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

   - fleeing from combat
   - recalling out of combat
   - being the target of certain spells
   - dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

AS a mortal you can reach a maximum of 101 levels, and there are a total of 120
levels in all.

Also, when you level, you will receive an autorestore, which will do two things. 
It removes any negative affects you might have suffered (ie. blind, plague, 
poison). And it restores your hp/mana/moves.

**Experience can also be gained by completing quests. Most quests on Ghost
  Dancer award experience for completing quests.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

New pets are planned for a shop in New Thalos.

~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.

~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

You can drop/get/give/put/take multiple items by typing <action> <number>*<item>
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.

~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.

~

0 FLEE RESCUE SURRENDER~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue <character>
Syntax: surrender <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

Surrendering is someting you can allways try once in a fight, but some 
might not accept surrender.

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL SCHAT~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: schat <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to

is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

Schat is the channel you share with the person you are married to. Only you and
your spouse can see this.

restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.

Forwarding notes

When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>
	sacrifice <all>

SACRIFICE offers an object to makoce, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

Be very carefull with the "Sacrifice all" though, it will
sacrifice all the items and corpses in a room.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.

~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.

~

0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>
Syntax: Nofollow

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.

NOFOLLOW is a command toggle that allows you to specify whether or not you
want other's to be able to follow you.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.

~

0 QUIT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

You will not be able to save your char before reaching level 2.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

~

0 RECALL / HRECALL~
Syntax: RECALL
		HRECALL set
		
RECALL prays to makoce for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Taka.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

Hrecall allows you to set a chosen recall spot. By entering HRECALL set, the current
location is set as target for HRECALL.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold

~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
move, mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

Type help MAX_STAT for more info
~

110 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.

~

110 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

~

108 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.

~

109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

~

106 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

An immortal must be at least level 118 to wizlock the game.

~

109 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.

~

107 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.

~

107 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than the deny command.

~

103 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 117 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

~

106 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).

~

106 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)

~

108 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)

~

105 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.

~

105 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

~

106 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
        purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers).  Mobiles may be purged if they are 
called directly by name.

~

106 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore room
        restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.

~

107 SLAY MSLAY GSLAY~
{GSyntax: {Rslay {W<character>{x

{GSlay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this{x
{Gcommand on players if you enjoy being a god.{x
{M** Only works in the same room{x

{GSyntax: {Rslay {W<character> !{x

{Gthrow. Be careful with this command!{x
{M** Works anywhere in the world. {RBE CAREFUL WITH THIS COMMAND!{x

{GSyntax: {Rgslay {W<character>{x

{GSlay kills a character in cold blood, for breaking the rules.  Best not to {x
{Guse this command on players who do not deserve it if you enjoy being a god.{x
{GThe gslay command presents a global warning and forces the victim to read{x
{Gthe rules. {x
{M** Idea by Pyrox of the Ghost Dancer MUD Project.{x

{GSyntax: {Rmslay {W<mob>{x

{GSlay kills a mob in cold blood, no saving throw.  

~

105 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 

~

104 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

~

104 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.

~

102 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, the name of a player or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.

~

102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
        wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 120 characters are totally 
invisible.

~

102 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.

~ 

102 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

~

106 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
        vnum <obj or mob> <name>
        vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)

~

103 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
        stat mob  <name>
        stat obj  <name>
        stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)

~

103 MWHERE OWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>
		owhere <name>
		
Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Owhere shows you the locations of all objects with a particular name.
~

105 PEACE WPEACE~
Syntax: peace
		wpeace
		
Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.

Wpeace, or world peace, stops ALL fighting, and that means literally everywhere
on the mud.
~

102 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)

~

109 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.

~

105 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

~

104 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
             return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.

~

102 IMMTALK : HEROTALK~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
        immtalk
		herotalk <message>
		herotalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).

Herotalk sends a message to all hero's, similar to Immtalk. This channel
can be seen by both Hero-level players and imms.

~

102 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet on/off
        wiznet 
        wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet on/off turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
Wiznet <field> toggles a field on and off.  The events should be 
self-explanatory, if they are not, fiddle with them a while.  More 
events are available at higher levels.
~

102 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.

~

-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.

victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with

the way of the non-magic user. It's potency on items is higer then the spell

~

102 NOTITLE~

This command allows immortals to prevent players from changing their title
This might be usefull in case of offensive titles from the player, or as a means of
showing punishment by the imm.

This command allows an imm to stop players from gaining experience points

A skill allowing the user to pahse out of existance making them immune to 
physical damage for a brief period of time.


~
0 axe dagger flail mace polearm spear sword whip~

The ability to use a weapon of this type.

~

0 shield block~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  Only the thief, warrior, ranger, paladin and assassin
classes may learn shield block. Beware, flails ignore shield blocking
attempts, and whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split
shields in two.
                                                    
~

0 bash~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.

~

0 enhanced damage~

This skill allows you to do more damage with an attack. It depends on your 
weapon skill and your skill in enhanced damage what the actual increase in damage is.
This skill does not require activation, if you have the skill, you use it.
~

0 parry~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting
attacks and is successful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon
for full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in
reduced damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs
when the defender is skilled in both his own and the opponent's weapon
type.

~

0 rescue~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior
with the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you
to intercede in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm.
Hopefully the favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on
the skill rating, as well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and
speed between the character and the target. 
(note: you rescue a friend, not the monster).

~

0 recall~

Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: /

RECALL prays to the god Pelor for miraculous transportation from
where you are back to the temple in your hometown.  / is a synonym
for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing). RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by
a curse may not recall at all.

~

0 butcher~

What to do with a corpse after you're done? Why not make use of it and get a few juicy steaks for your effort?

With this skill you can turn corpses into food.

~

0 dirt kicking~

Considered by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.
The blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.
Dexterity helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick. 

~

0 second attack~

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional
strikes in combat, however, a 100% second attack skill does NOT guarantee
2 attacks every round. 

~

0 hand to hand~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill. Learning this style of fighting gives
the player a weapon even when disarmed -- his or her bare hands. Trained
hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.

~

0 Fast healing~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking,
resting, or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and
it is possible for it to fail.

~

0 kick~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a
powerful kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off
balance.  If a player becomes a master at this skill, he/she will be
able to do more damage with the roundhouse attack.

~

0 hide sneak~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary. 

Sneak may be used when moving (including to sneak by monsters), but has a
lower chance of success.

~

0 disarm~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when
you are skilled in both your own and your opponent's weapon.

~

0 third attack~

Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.
A perfect third attack skill of 100% does NOT assure three attacks per
round. 

~

0 dodge~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving
the character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss
the target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.

~

0 haggle~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a
character to match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better
price for merchandise, or to buy at the lowest possible cost.
Unfortunately, most merchants are already very skilled at haggling,
so the untrained adventurer had best guard his treasure closely.

~

0 peek~

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  The peek skill functions automatically when you look at
a character or mob.

~
0 trip~

Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves using any one of a
number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground. Tripping
large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will find
the attack easy to avoid. 

~

0 meditation~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration
and mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or
resting

~

0 staves wands scrolls~

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks
the necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.
The item skills are as follows:

scrolls  The reading of magical scrolls and books (see help recite)
staves   The use of staves and similar devices (see help brandish)
wands    The use of wands and similar items (see help zap)

~

0 berserk~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane
rage in combat. Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell --
a huge surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal
safety.  Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.

~

0 lore~

Syntax: lore <object name>

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends.
Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an
object concerning its power and uses. It also may occasionally increase
the value of an object, because more will be known about its worth.

You must be holding the object in your inventory that you want to use the
lore skill on.

~

0 pick lock~


Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves and assassins,
allowing them to gain access to many secured areas.  Lock picking
chances are improved by intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty
of the lock. 

~

0 counter~

This skill enables you to turn the attack of your enemy back on him.

~

0 critical strike~

Critical strike is a skill, that when learned, will increase the fighter's
chance of delivering a death blow to the victim.  This is a straight 2% chance
of killing the mob in one hit.

If the percent chance fails, critical strike will still increase the amount
of damage that is dealt from the attack.

Critical strike skill by:

~
0 circle backstab assassinate~
Syntax: backstab <target>
Syntax: circle <target>
Syntax: assassinate <target>

Backstab is a skill that is needed for those surprise attacks. It initiates
combat, but gives you a first strike.

{R"author: morning glory"{x
The circle command lets you backstab while you are fighting, thus allowing
for a second attack. Only assassins may learn circle.  Circle now has a
small chance of killing a mob in one attack.

This chance is calculated based our you level:

        1% chance/20 levels of experience

Assassinate is a more powerfull version of backstab.
~

0 steal~

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins or an object from a character. There are
penalties for using STEAL on other players. In order to STEAL successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

~

0 delete~
Syntax:	delete <password>

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name
will be available for use. Typing delete with an
argument will return your character to 'safe' status if you change your
mind after the first delete.

NOTE: You must play your character at least ONCE EVERY 3 MONTH.
      All player files are scanned every month and anyone that has not
      logged on in the last 90 days will be deleted.
      However, if you are going away for an extended period of time, tell
      any Immortal and we will make sure nothing happens to your player file


 ~ 

0 'magic missile'~ 
Syntax:  'magic missile' <target>

that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target

0 'cause light' 'cause serious' 'cause critical' 'harm'~ 
Syntax:  'cause light' <target> 
Syntax:  'cause serious' <target> 
Syntax:  'cause critical' <target> 
Syntax:  'harm' <target> 
 
These spells cause various degrees of physical injury to the victim. 
The higher the spell level, the more damage it does.

0 'cure blindness' 'cure disease' 'cure poison'~ 
Syntax:  'cure blindness' <target> 
Syntax:  'cure disease' <target> 
Syntax:  'cure poison' <target> 
 
When you are affected by blindness, disease or poison, these spells will cure 
you of the effects of those spells. 
 
~ 
 
0 'faerie fog'~ 
Syntax:  'faerie fog' <target> 
 
This spell enables the caster to outline one or more objects or creatures with a 
pale glowing light. This will make the target easier to hit, since it is now 
clearly visible. 
 
~ 
 
0 'burning hands' ~ 
Syntax:  'burning hands' <target> 
 
Once cast, a fan of flame shoots from the wizard's touching thumbs and 
outstretched hands. The fan reaches three feet forward from the thumbs, and 
extends 60 degrees to the right and left, gradually shortening until the fan 
slopes into the wrists 
 
 
~ 
 
0 refresh~ 
Syntax:  refresh <target> 
 
This spell, when cast, restores a number of movement points to the target. 
 
 
~ 
 
0 'protection evil' 'protection good'~ 
Syntax:  'protection evil' <target> 
Syntax:  'protection good' <target> 
 
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a 
distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has a major effect:
All attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures in case of protection 
evil, or good in case of protection good against the protected creature receive 
a penalty on it's attacks.
 
~ 
 
0 'shocking grasp' 'chill touch'~ 
Syntax:  'shocking grasp' <target> 
Syntax:  'chill touch' <target> 
 
These spells do damage to a target. When the wizard casts shocking grasp, he 
develops a powerful electrical charge that gives a jolt to the creature touched. 

Chill touch does cold damage.
 
~ 
 
0 'dispel evil' 'dispel good'~
Syntax:  'dispel evil' <target> 
Syntax:  'dispel good' <target> 

Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on the
pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their peril.

Dispel evil invokes the wrath of ANON on an evil victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are not pure of heart.

~ 
 
0 bless~ 
Syntax:  bless <target> 
 
This spell improves the to-hit roll and saving throw versus spell of the
target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be
cast on an object to temporarily bless it (blessed weapons, for example,
are more effective against demonic beings).
 
~ 
 
0 earthquake~ 
 
When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. 
The shock is over in one round. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, 
structures, and creatures in its area of effect.

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!


~ 
 
0 blindness~ 
Syntax:  blindness <target> 
 
"To strike your opponent you need to see your opponent" - ancient saying. 
With this spell you take away your foe's ability to see, thus making him 
more or less helpless.
 
~ 
 
0 'floating disc'~ 
Syntax:  'floating disc' 
 
This useful spell creates a floating disc field of force which follows
the caster around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear
of weight penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in
hours, and usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster,
with a maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float
location on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die
or allow it to run out of energy
 
~ 
 
0 fireproof~ 
syntax  fireproof <target> 
 
The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
 
~ 
 
0 plague ~ 
Syntax  plague <target> 
 
The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great
virulence, sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly
leading to death. It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread
like wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area. Most players
announce if they have plague before returning to recall in order to warn
other players, who will then have a chance of leaving the area and avoiding
contracting the plague as well. You need the 'cure disease' spell to cure
the plague.
 
~

0 curse~
Syntax	curse <target>

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells.
It also renders the character unclean in the eyes of Mota and unable
to RECALL. Curse may be used to fill equipment with evil power, allowing
(for example) weapons to do more damage to particularly holy opponents.

~

0 lightning bolt~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical 
energy. Striking down from the sky, it is a dangerous thing to face.

~

0 weaken~

What do you do when you face an opponent that is stronger then you? 
With this spell, you can even out the difference a bit. Casting this spell on an 
opponent will cause him to lose some of his strenght.

~

0 calm~

One of the most useful, and often overlooked, abilities of the master
cleric is the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in
a room.  Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and
are at a disadvantage in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.
The more violent activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and
it is all or nothing --either all combat in the room is ended (with the
exception of those who are immune to magic) or none is.
~

0 colour spray~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing
colors to spring forth from his hand. Blind or unseeing creatures are not 
affected by the spell.

Creatures affected by this spell are struck unconscious or are blinded.

~

0 giant strength~

This spell is rather the opposite of "weaken". By casting this spell on a 
target, the caster can magically enhance the strength of the target. This is not 
a permanent effect.
 

~

0 call lightning ~

When a call lightning spell is cast, there must be a storm of some sort in the 
area--a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a 
tornado. The caster is then able to call down bolts of lightning.

Note that this spell only works outdoors.
~

0 control weather~
Syntax	'control weather' worse
Syntax	'control weather' better

This spell allows a caster to create better or worse weather conditions, mainly 
in conjunction with the 'call lightning' spell. The caster can either turn the 
weather better or worse then current conditions.

~

0 fly~

Are you wearing out those boots too fast? Are your feet weary from all that 
walking? Why not fly?

With this spell you can allow yourself or another target to fly.

~

0 remove curse~

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an 
object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. 
Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, 
weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the 
person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special 
curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster 
of a certain level or more.

~

0 summon~

"If the mountain will not come to Methusalem, then Methusalem must come to the 
mountain."

With this spell that no longer holds true. A wizard can use this spell to bring 
the target to him, instead of having to go to the target.

Note that the summon spell only works on targets of lower level and targets who 
are not immune to summoning.

~

0 energy drain~

this spell saps the experience points, hit points, mana, and
movement points of its target.  The caster however only gains hit points
from the vitim.  The higher the level of the spell, the more damage it does.
Only the Necromancer may use this spell.

~

0 heat metal~

If you have ever grabbed something off the fire by mistake, the effects of this 
spell can be imagined. Casting heat metal on a target causes all the metal items 
that the target is wearing to become very hot indeed. This causes damage, and 
forces the target to drop the items affected.

~

0 create rose~

This spell creates a beautifull rose.

~

0 adrenaline~

This spell pumps up the mighty warrior to help increase his to-hit and
to-dam rolls, like giving him a "shot of adrenaline."  However, there
is a side affect of a penalty to armor class, making the recipient
somewhat easier to hit.

~

0 fireball~

This spell inflicts direct magical damage on the victim and is a vital
part of the mage's arsenal of magics. The higher the level of the spell,
the more damage it causes.

~

0 frenzy~

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety,
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's
alignment

~

0 flamestrike~

This spell inflicts direct magical damage on the victim and is a vital
part of the mage's arsenal of magics. The higher the level of the spell,
the more damage it causes.

~

0 gate~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in
the world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have,
but not other members of your group.  Monsters receive a save against
gate, and monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can
not be gated to at all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no-recall rooms
cannot be gated to, and no-recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally,
any IMM or Hero is also immune to gate, as well as any player who has
no-summon set.  Clan members may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan
members

~

0 haste~

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient,
allowing an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving
evasive abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the
system, such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable
of negating the slow spell. (see 'help slow')

~

0 'dispel magic' 'cancellation'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>

Both of these spells remove magical affects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considered an attack spell. Cancel-
lation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does not
provoke attack.  Unfortunately, these spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.

The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent
spells (such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all
spells may be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague, which
must be cured.

~

0 sanctuary~

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any
attack by one half. Only clerics and paladins may use the sanctuary spell


~

0 slow~

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a
spell with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate
victim, it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its
rate of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halves
healing rates, due to reduced metabolism

~
0 'GAS BREATH' 'ACID BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~

Syntax: cast 'gas breath'       <area affect>
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>


These spells allow the caster to breath forth the breath of a dragon.
Acid and Lightning damage one victim whereas Gas, Frost, and Fire damages
everyone in the room.  Fire and Frost can break objects, and Acid can
damage armor.  These spells are listed in order of power, with Gas Breath
doing the least damage and Lightning Breath doing the most

~

0 smoke screen~

Smoke Screen is a powerful shield spell allowing the caster to gain
a -80 to his/her AC for a limited time. It is part of the Infernosphere
group.

~

0 chain lightning~

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target within the room, until its force is
fully expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell even if they
are members of a dynasty or group, while the caster himself will not be struck
unless no other viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective
when used on groups of creatures.

~

0 teleport~

This spell takes you from your current location to a random location
somewhere in the world. This spell can be found in the transportation
group.

~

0 pass door~

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed and locked doors.

0 portal~

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way
portal to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.
Portals are entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.
Portals cannot be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape
from gate-proof rooms. Portal requires a special source of power to
be used,namely a warp stone.

~

0 holy word~

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god,
with disastrous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with
powerful blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment
in the room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those
of opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and
drained of vitality.

powered portal spell. Both spells require an additional power source, namely a 
warp stone.

~

0 witch~

Anyone familiar with the witches of Greek myth, or of medieval legend would know that the witch is 
not simply a subclass of the mage, locked in an internal battle against arcane spirits. Witches such 
as Circe, Rhiannon, or even Morgan LeFey were priestesses of Gods and Goddesses who were lesser 
known, but ultimately no more or less nefarious than their better known kindred. The essence of 
witchcraft is knowledge, secrecy, ritual, and a sense of respect for the powers of nature. Evil is 
not a necessary part of witchcraft, though certainly the secrecy of their sects has opened them to 
numerous rumors. Whatever their alignment, witches have more in common with druidic priests than any 
other class of character, though the way in which their spells work often is reminiscent of 
magecraft

~

0 Warrior~ 

The warrior is a champion, swordsman, soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by his knowledge of 
weapons and tactics. Warriors can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with 
monsters and villains. A good warrior needs to be strong and healthy if he hopes to survive.

~

0 'Paladin' 'Deathknight'~

The paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the example of everything good and true. Like the fighter, 
the paladin is a man of combat. However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, 
honesty, piety, and chivalry. He strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others 
might learn from him as well as gain by his actions.

Deathknights are exactly like paladins except for the fact that they oppose all good. 

~

0 Ranger~

The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in tracking 
and woodcraft. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger 
needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.

~

0 'Mage' 'Priest'~

Mage: The Mage strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. 
To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical 
research.

A mage must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. The mage studies all types of magic and learns a 
wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring. 

Cleric: A Cleric sees to the spiritual needs of a community or location. 

The cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the needs of a community. He is both 
protector and healer. He is not purely defensive, however. When evil threatens, the cleric is well-
suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it.

~

0 'Thief'~

Thief: The thief can be found throughout the world, wherever people gather and money changes hands. 
While many thieves are motivated only by a desire to amass fortune in the easiest way possible, some 
thieves have noble aims; they use their skills to correct injustice, spread good will, or contribute 
to the success of an adventuring group.

To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and 
stealth are his hallmarks. Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by and wealthy 
merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the thief to make.

~

0 Assassin~

This class is intended for evil aligned characters, as the act of killing for pay cannot be justified 
as a good act. In any society there exists an element that wishes to dispose of rivals, business 
competitors, and any others deemed to be in the way. It is to this element that the assassin, a hired 
killer. Unlike simple warriors or soldiers, the assassin relies on anonymity and surprise to 
earn his living. A successful assassin may not even be seen by his target. Slipping out of the 
darkness or a crowd of friends, the assassin does his dark deed and disappears.

Social ranks: Assassins tend to be well off, as their services are expensive. Further, they often are 
educated, which helps them fit into different segments of society to stalk their prey.

~
-1 PETNAME~
.
This command allows you to rename your pets!  The syntax is really quite
simple, you have four options; [name|short|long|desc] and they work like
this.

Syntax: petname name dino  (renames your pet to "dino")
Syntax: petname short a fierce, mottled mutt!
Syntax: petname long Dino, the stalwart companion of (your name) is here.

The NAME you give your pet is what you must use in order to LOOK at it.
If you call your pet FIDO, like the example above, the you must use LOOK FIDO
to look at it.

The SHORT description for your pet is what you will see in combat and what
is displayed just before the health indicator when you look at it.  Ex: When
you LOOK at your pet you will see its description, then you will see its
SHORT description followed by "is in perfect health".

The LONG description is what everyone will see when the pet is in the room.
So, if you used the LONG description that is in the example above you would
see (Charmed) Dino, the stalwart companion of _____ is here, every time
you looked at the room.

Your pets DESCRIPTION is the main piece of info that is displayed when you
look at your pet.  In order to use multiple lines in your pets description,
simply use the {{/ command to force a new line.
Ex: This large dog is resting comfortably here.{{/Better not bother him.

~

102 FRECALL 'force recall'~
Syntax: frecall <player>

This command forces a player to recall to his hometown. 
~

-1 GLAIVE~

The glaive is a knife-bladed spear.  It has the thrusting function of the spear
and the secondary cutting function of the convex blade of the knife.  The weapon
was rapidly enlarged in the blade in order to give it a greater cutting function
as well as a cleaving attack.
~

-1 GUISARME~

The guisarme was furnished with a sharp cutting edge along its convex side,
probably from reverse spike to hook.  The spike, of course, could be used
to penetrate armor when the weapon was swung, and the curved hook provided
an ample means of pulling horsemen to the ground.
~

-1 HALBERD~

This form of pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe in early examples,
but the head is set at a convenient angle, so this alone makes it quite
distinct from an ordinary long-hafted axe.  The whole weapon often reached
8 feet in length.  It was also always topped with a fairly long spear point
and backed by a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward.
The spear point is, of course, designed to keep oponents at bay and deliver
a thrusting attack.
~

-1 VOULGE~

Place a hefty cleaver at the end of a long, stout shaft, and the leverage
which the polearm gives the wielder will enable him to cleave through
armor.  The voulge has no provision to keep the enemy at a distance in its
simple form, but if the top front or back edge is ground down so as to
provide a pointed or dagger-like tip, the weapon assumes a more completed
form.
~

-1 PIKE~

Although there is not set rule, any spear with a shaft of 15 feet or longer
is considered to be a pike.  The pike is designed to deliver a thrusting
attack at an oponent at long range, and its great length was used to keep
him there, as the weapon was always used in mass.  One of the most common
form of pike is the awl pike, a strictly piercing weapon, although there
are many other forms of blades which were used.  Swiss and German pikes
were fashioned so that metal protected the wooden shaft up to 2 feet from
the head, so that an enemy could not easily lop the blade off and make
the weapon useless.
~

-1 RANSEUR~

At first glance, a ranseur appears to be a form of spetum, or vice versa, but
the purpose of the design of the former weapon is more complex than that of
the latter. A ranseur's secondary blades are backward-hooking projections set
well below the large central blade.
~

-1 BARDICHE~

This very broad and heavy axe links the pole axes to the pole cleavers as a sort
of transitional step between the two forms, although its only obvious use is
as a military arm.  A bardiche head ranged from about 2 feet to over 3 feet in
length, and it was attached to its haft with two rings or a single one in those
examples where the blade is shorter and backed with a hammer head or spike.
~

-1 SPEAR~

The spear is a dagger set atop a pole.  It is principally a thursting weapon
but if a broad blade is attached it can also be used as a cutting weapon.
~

-1 LANCE~

A lance is a long spear carried by a mounted person.  Usually around 12 feet
in length, some even as long as 14 feet.  Just as with the spear and pike,
many different heads were attached to the end of the lance shaft to meet the
requirements of varying oponents armor.
~

-1 POLEAXE~

Strictly speaking, a pole axe is nothing more than an axe head of any sort set
upon a long haft in order to to deliver an earlier and more forceful blow.  It
can be double bitted, backed by a spike, and or topped off with a dagger point,
but it is still recognizable as an axe.
~

-1 POLEARM~

Ghost Dancer has various polearm weapons.  Please see the following help files:
Poleaxe, Lance, Spear, Bardiche, Ranseur, Pike, Volgue, Guisarme, Halberd,

If i were to choose a mage my class bonus is +2 Int therefore my max stats 
would be Str 21 Int 23 Wis 21 Dex 21 Con 21.

0 STORY~
The age before time

In the age before time there were two ageless beings who created the
universe. In this age of creation there was lots of work to be done.
Creatures and plants were created from thought and whole worlds took 
shape in the blink of an eye.

The concepts of time and a circle of life were introduced as the new
universe took shape. Beings were born and died all in the order of the 
great circle of life.  The duo gave their creations the ability to 
learn, grow, and evolve into more than they were.

As they worked they created one world they loved above all, teaming 
with life and filled with wonders known only there.  It was our 
world, Ea. With their very hands they guided our evolution and this 
world became the most beautiful anywhere in the cosmos.

Centuries passed, and millennia followed. The duo slowly drifted apart, 
each creating stars, planets, life of all sorts, and giving of 
themselves to each of their new creations.

One must have given too much of herself and disappeared forever. When 
the other learned of this tragedy he was unwilling to lose his mate. 
So he returned to the world they made together, the world she loved 
so much and started a new ritual called the Ghost Dance, in the hopes 
of drawing his loved one back to him once more. This world is known 
for his dance now and he is known as the Ghost Dancer.


The Coming of the Gods.

Whilst he continued his unrelenting dance, the Dancer thought of ways
to relieve the anguish of eternally hoping his mate would return.  On
a whim he introduced Gods to his world, who he called the Valar.  They 
were eleven in number, and the Dancer put them in charge of all his 
creations.

Then an idea came to his mind which was enormous in its potential - 
the concept of Good and Evil.

The first God, Elathan, he made completely Good and ruler of the 
heavens. Elathan's mate, Miriel, was also Good, indeed the most 
compassionate of the Dancer's creations, and became the healer of 
the hurts to the universe.

The names of the others were Yatai, Anval, Kiana, the brothers Vilya 
and Ormal, Fentia, Glok, Bodan and Marth.

Each was given special powers over certain of the myriad aspects of
the world the Dancer had created named Ea.

Now some of the Gods he made Good and some Neutral, but none was 
entirely Evil save one. And he was called Narok the Black, who dwelt 
alone and was not one of the Valar.  The Dancer gave him great 
power, went back to his dancing, and waited to see what would 
happen ....


The Battles of the Universe

For countless ages the Gods worked alone in the universe, shaping, 
modifying and strengthening all the life forms created by the 
Dancer.  Thus were born the elves, dwarves, humans and many other 
races of great variety.

These beings built homes and eventually cities for themselves on the 
golden world of Ea, the finest city being Thalion, which the elves 
constructed on the first continent of Rodania.

But Narok saw the new life and feared and hated it. In envy and 
mockery he fostered the foul races of goblins, vampires, drow, and 
many others, placing them throughout the Universe to make war upon 
the other races.  For a time Narok had the upper hand, and the 
Universe was filled with corruption.  Though the gods endeavored to 
keep order and to protect their peoples, Narok and his hosts were 
forever ruining their work.

Eventually there was no alternative for Elathan and the Valar but to 
attempt to destroy Narok.  Great battles raged across the heavens and 
throughout the world of Ea, bringing terrible destruction.


The Coming of the Immortals

The Ghost Dancer paused in his sad eternal dance, and remembered his
creation.  He saw that without his further intervention, all of his 
created world of Ea would be destroyed in the fierceness of the 
battles between the forces he had unleashed, Good and Evil, 
particularly as Evil seemed to be winning.

So he created the Immortals, selected members of the races he had put
on Ea, and gave each extraordinary powers so that they could go forth 
and change the course of history.

This small band of heroes fought, bled, and eventually brought peace
back to Ea. They were a diverse group of characters, and not all 
followed Elathan in the ways of Good.  Some were evil and favoured 
Narok, others neutral with Yatai as their God.  But under the strong
leadership of the mighty Taka and Kaithan, order took the place of 
chaos.

The Immortals remain among us to this day, ever vigilant over this
land.  Without them the war would continue unrelenting even on the now 
safe Rodania. It is rumored they live on a small island paradise 
somewhere out on the Endless Ocean. Ever watchful of the threat that 
one day Narok might return, this time stronger than before.


The Forgetting.

"The horrors of all these wars over many centuries were so savage that
Elathan cast a spell over the 25 races living on Rodania, the first
continent of Ea.   This was merciful, causing them to forget all the
carnage that had killed their loved ones and almost destroyed their
civilisation.  All memories of those other continents across the seas, 
where Narok's minions had once held sway, were banished from their minds.
And peace came to Ea.

But deep underground, Narok stirred, for Evil once created will never
be destroyed ....

And the Ghost Dancer danced his lonely dance high above the firmament
of heavens ....


The Present

With the hopes of glory and thoughts of the unknown you can start
your journey today.

Will you help shape the forces of destiny on Ea?

There is but one way to find out for sure. Join us and start your 
quest.
